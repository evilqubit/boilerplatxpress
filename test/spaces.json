LEVYdance re-branded the space in 2012 during its 10th Anniversary Season, and now hosts a wide array of classes, rehearsals, and events in the space.","price":[{"id":"ddffd5599a5811e3a77e064cf8c38b5b","type":"HOURLY_RATE","value":3000,"currency":"USD"},{"id":"dea1b0e09a5811e3a77e064cf8c38b5b","type":"DAILY_RATE","value":48000,"currency":"USD"}],"space_use":[{"id":"47d9bb7291a611e3ac9a064cf8c38b5b","name":"Event"},{"id":"3607cbad1eb311e4882106f116f37bf8","name":"Production"}],"longitude":-122.408434,"amenities":[{"id":"236fc45c506a11e3ac85068e8ff47d33","name":"WiFi"},{"id":"d2ea27d791cd11e3ac9a064cf8c38b5b","name":"Sound System"},{"id":"d2ea28d691cd11e3ac9a064cf8c38b5b","name":"Mirrors"},{"id":"d2ea2bbd91cd11e3ac9a064cf8c38b5b","name":"Lighting Equipment"}],"number_guests":200,"owner":{"first_name":"Rony ","url":"/account/42638a185e0811e3ac85068e8ff47d33","user_id":"42638a185e0811e3ac85068e8ff47d33","last_name":"Chammas","position":"Director","avatar_url":"http://d1vhgu7jjbo4cc.cloudfront.net/api/v1/images/27af46221c704c7d96b89a47facae10e"},"rules":"We simply like to know what activities will be going on in our space, and have options for contact with the individual or group renting our space.
