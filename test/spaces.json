There is a delight waiting to be found in every corner, and as you descend through the ten terraces you are met with breathtaking views of the City, the soothing sounds of our WaterContraptions, and the quirky wonder of the garden itself.    The space works well for a gathering of up to 100 people.  You will find large open areas for gathering, secluded, cozy spots for enjoying the views, a lovely archway for weddings, plantings to please the eye and eleven working fountains to calm the ear.  •The “Way Down” is our barbeque area.  The space has a fire pit, patio heaters, a working sink, ‘fridge, stereo system, extra large charcoal ‘que, lots of seating and a treehouse!  •The upper garden terrace is a great place to put out tables and chairs for brunch or banquet and leads to a weatherproof sitting area that easily converts to a dance floor.     •The lawn area is shaded by our lovely almond tree and is a perfect spot to sit and toast the sunset.  •The “Sunset Deck” is the Fall and Winter spot to catch the very last rays of the sun each day. Views of Twin Peaks and Sutro tower, the Mission, Golden Gate Bridge and the Marin Headlands.   •“The Casbah” features a built-in seating unit – great for watching the late afternoon fog roll through the Golden Gate while you sit warm and sunny in Bernal Heights.  (It’s also our favorite afternoon napping spot!)  •The Upper Deck holds twenty people and looks over the entire property.  Our best viewing spot, you can see across the City to the Golden Gate Bridge and Mt. Tam beyond, the downtown skyline and Coit Tower in the distance.  Has patio heaters, stools along the railing “bar” and plenty of other seating.  A refuge from the bustle and stress of the City, a place where you can feel truly relaxed and peaceful, a perfect spot for your next gathering.  Come see for yourself why our garden has truly earned the title, “Magical”.   Your booking includes a bedroom and the use of two bathrooms and the kitchen.  The bedroom provides the access to the garden and accommodation for up to three guests.   There is another bedroom available to rent and sometimes it is also possible to rent the entire house.   There is PLENTY OF PARKING in our spacious neighborhood.   The 67 bus line (which connects to BART) stops right outside our house.
