The space has a fire pit, patio heaters, a working sink, ‘fridge, stereo system, extra large charcoal ‘que, lots of seating and a treehouse!  •The upper garden terrace is a great place to put out tables and chairs for brunch or banquet and leads to a weatherproof sitting area that easily converts to a dance floor.     •The lawn area is shaded by our lovely almond tree and is a perfect spot to sit and toast the sunset.  •The “Sunset Deck” is the Fall and Winter spot to catch the very last rays of the sun each day. Views of Twin Peaks and Sutro tower, the Mission, Golden Gate Bridge and the Marin Headlands.   •“The Casbah” features a built-in seating unit – great for watching the late afternoon fog roll through the Golden Gate while you sit warm and sunny in Bernal Heights.  (It’s also our favorite afternoon napping spot!)  •The Upper Deck holds twenty people and looks over the entire property.  Our best viewing spot, you can see across the City to the Golden Gate Bridge and Mt. Tam beyond, the downtown skyline and Coit Tower in the distance.  Has patio heaters, stools along the railing “bar” and plenty of other seating.  A refuge from the bustle and stress of the City, a place where you can feel truly relaxed and peaceful, a perfect spot for your next gathering.

Formerly known as Studio Gracia, LEVYdance assumed management of the space in 2007 after the company had been rehearsing here for 3 years. The space became known for hosting a full roster of eclectic weekly open classes like Argentine Tango, movement meditation, and double dutch. LEVYdance re-branded the space in 2012 during its 10th Anniversary Season, and now hosts a wide array of classes, rehearsals, and events in the space.","price":[{"id":"ddffd5599a5811e3a77e064cf8c38b5b","type":"HOURLY_RATE","value":3000,"currency":"USD"},{"id":"dea1b0e09a5811e3a77e064cf8c38b5b","type":"DAILY_RATE","value":48000,"currency":"USD"}],"space_use":[{"id":"237fd37c506a11e3ac85068e8ff47d33","name":"Events"},{"id":"3607cbad1eb311e4882106f116f37bf8","name":"Production"}],"longitude":-122.408434,"amenities":[{"id":"236fc45c506a11e3ac85068e8ff47d33","name":"WiFi"},{"id":"d2ea27d791cd11e3ac9a064cf8c38b5b","name":"Sound System"},{"id":"d2ea28d691cd11e3ac9a064cf8c38b5b","name":"Mirrors"},{"id":"d2ea2bbd91cd11e3ac9a064cf8c38b5b","name":"Lighting Equipment"}],"share_link":null,"number_guests":200,"owner":{"first_name":"Rony ","url":"/account/42638a185e0811e3ac85068e8ff47d33","user_id":"42638a185e0811e3ac85068e8ff47d33","last_name":"C","position":"Director","avatar_url":"http://a4.res.cloudinary.com/peerspace-inc/image/upload/v1/prod_images/api/v1/images/27af46221c704c7d96b89a47facae10e"},"rules":"We simply like to know what activities will be going on in our space, and have options for contact with the individual or group renting our space.
